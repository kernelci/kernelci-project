<p>2020 was the first year of the KernelCI project under the Linux Foundation
and has been an interesting one. Maybe slightly less “interesting” than the rest
of the world-changing events of 2020, but it’s still been an adventure. This
article aims to give a quick summary of the major milestones of the first year
of KernelCI project, and highlight our goals for the next year.</p>

<h2>Highlights of the first year</h2>
<p>The founding members spent the end of 2019 doing a formal launch and ramping
up the project structure and organization. This led to
<a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/mission-objectives/">our mission statement and key goals</a>.
Throughout 2020 we gave talks and led discussions at several virtual conferences
such as FOSDEM, Open-Source Summit / Embedded Linux Conference (ELC). Check out
<a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/blog/">our blog</a> for more details
about the talks and discussions from these events.</p>

<p><strong>Community Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>In the middle of 2020, we did a Community survey to get a sense for what the
kernel testing and automation community was looking for. This survey has helped
guide where we focus our time and resources. See our blog for an article
covering the
<a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/blog/2020/07/09/kernelci-community-survey-report/">full results of the survey</a>.</p>

<p>One highlight of the 2020 conference circuit was Linux Plumbers Conference
(LPC). At LPC, we gave talks and held focused discussions with our target
audience: kernel developers and maintainers. The full details are
<a href="https://foundation.kernelci.org/blog/2020/09/23/kernelci-notes-from-plumbers-2020/">in a blog article covering the event</a>,
but this is where we kicked off public discussions of how to unify test results
and reporting from various testing and CI efforts in the community. We’re
calling this common datastore for kernel testing results kcidb. Thanks to the
discussions kicked off at LPC, we’re now collecting results from several other
projects such as Red Hat CKI, Google syzbot, Arm, Gentoo, and the Fuego project.
Continued collaboration with these projects as well as other new ones will be a
focus area for 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Another area of growth in 2020 was in our IT infrastructure. As you might
expect, we do lots of kernel builds, and that requires lots of compute
horsepower. Our build capacity had been capped by a fixed number of donated
build machines. But now, thanks to the generous donations of founding members
Google and Microsoft, we now have scalable cloud compute resources under Google
Compute Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure which we manage with Kubernetes so
that we can dynamically scale as our compute needs grow.</p>


<h2><strong>Looking forward</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Kicking off 2021</strong></p>
<p>The governing board kicked off our 2nd year with some project organizational
matters such as budgeting and electing this year's executive committee. We are
very happy to welcome Guillaume Tucker (Collabora) as the new board chair and
Chris Paterson (CIP/Renesas) as the new treasurer. We also say a big thank you
to outgoing chair Kevin Hilman (BayLibre) and outgoing treasurer Guy Lunardi
(Collabora).</p>

<h3>Focus areas</h3>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the collaboration with other testing and CI projects will
remain a major focus for 2021. We want it to be easy for anyone doing kernel
testing to be able to submit results to our open, centralized datastore: KCIDB.
The amount of data we’re collecting is growing rapidly, so we’re also looking
for help from “big data” experts to help us build the tooling to visualize and
learn from all the data. Please write to us on the mailing list if you have any
interest in helping here.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been using Jenkins for years to manage our CI pipeline jobs, but as
we’ve moved more of our infrastructure into the cloud, we’re looking at ways to
migrate our CI infrastructure to a cloud-native framework such as Tekton or
Jenkins-X. We’re in the early stages of exploration here, so anyone with
experience here that could help guide us, we’d love to hear from you!</p>

<p><strong>Data Visualization & Analysis</strong></p>
<p>We’re also in the early stages of planning new dashboards for visualization
and analysis of our growing data set. We’re soliciting feedback from the broader
community by
<a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/discussions/618">collecting user stories</a>
to better understand what our users want from new dashboards. In addition to
making all the testing data and logs available through advanced visualization
tools, we’d also like to enable analytics and deep learning on our growing data
set. Once again, this is something we’d love your help on, so if you’re a big
data enthusiast and want to put your skills to use to help the Linux kernel,
please let us know.</p>

<p><strong>Get involved!</strong></p>
<p>Did you notice any themes above? We’re looking for help! We have some big
ideas and plans, but we’re still a very small team and are looking for expertise
in a few areas to help guide the future of the project.</p>

<p>Please keep in touch with what we’re up to or to get involved, you can read
