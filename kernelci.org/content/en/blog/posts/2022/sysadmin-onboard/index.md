  The KernelCI.org project welcomes Vince Hille as SysAdmin
---

Recently, we posted about the [Request For Proposals](../rfp-sysadmin/) to undertake SysAdmin tasks
for KernelCI.org. That process is now complete, and we are delighted to announce
that the KernelCI advisory board hired Vince Hille from Revenni Inc to conduct
the work.

Vince will worked together with the Technical Steering Committee(TSC) of the project to
maintain and improve the current project infrastructure. As KernelCI.org scales with
more kernels being built and more tests being run, we definitely need help to keep 
our systems stable and up-to-date.

The KernelCI project relies on a number of web services which need constant
maintenance. These include databases, automation tools and web dashboards for
several instances. Some are hosted on dedicated virtual machines (VMs), others
in the cloud.
