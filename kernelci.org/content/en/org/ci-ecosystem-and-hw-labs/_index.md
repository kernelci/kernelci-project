As shown in the KernelCI Architecture, we have several players from the CI Ecosystem & HW labs in KernelCI. You can see all of them in our [home page](https://kernelci.org/).

We keep all the [logos](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-project/tree/main/kernelci.org/content/en/org/ci-ecosystem-and-hw-labs/logos/) in this git repo. There is also a template there to build the image for labs owned by an individual (e.g. kernel maintainers with their own labs).

This page exists to facilitate keeping the home page sync'ed with all logos.
