<p>KernelCI officially launched as a Linux Foundation project at the end of
October 2019. Now that we’re several months into the project, it’s time to
launch a blog so everyone can keep track of what’s going on.</p>

{{< imgproc featured-image-blog2 Fit "800x300" >}}{{< /imgproc >}}

<p>To get the blog started, here’s a bit of what we’ve been up to since the
project launch.</p>

<h3>Setup / Administration</h3>
<p>To get things off to an official start, we spent some time with the member
companies getting to know each other better and establishing our basic
governance structure. We now have a governing board, made up of one
representative from each of the member companies: BayLibre, Civil Infrastructure
Platform, Collabora, Foundries.io, Google, Microsoft and Red Hat. The governing
board meets weekly for planning, discussion, budgeting decisions and to set
priorities for the technical steering committee.</p>

<p>Recent GB accomplishments</p>
<ul>
  <li>established and published project
    <a href="https://kernelci.org/mission-objectives/">Mission &amp; Objectives</a></li>
  <li>welcomed <a href="https://ltsi.linuxfoundation.org/">Long-Term Stable Initiative (LTSi)</a>
    as associate member</li>
  <li>established collaborative development between existing CI projects under
    the KernelCI umbrella (kernelci.org and Red Hat CKI)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Technical</h3>
<p>The technical steering committee (TSC) is where technical decisions are made
and software implementation details are discussed during a weekly call as well
as on our mailing list. Both the weekly call and mailing list are open to the
public (details below.)</p>
<p>Some highlights of recent accomplishments</p>
<ul>
  <li>improvements to kernelci.org frontend to view test results (previously
    only boot reports were available in the UI)</li>
  <li>building the kernel with clang (including latest version: clang-10)</li>
  <li>kcidb
    <ul>
      <li>prototype of a new schema and datastore/schema using Google BigQuery</li>
      <li>combined results from kernelci.org and Red Hat CKI</li>
      <li>prototype of new email reports based on kcidb</li>
      <li>prototype of new web UI using kcidb based on Grafana</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>And some active areas of development and future work ( help wanted! )</p>
<ul>
  <li>increasing test coverage by enabling more test suites to run (kselftest,
    KUnit, LTP, xfstests, etc&#8230;)</li>
  <li>increased build capacity: thanks to generous donations from Google and
    Microsoft, we are migrating to using Kubernetes to manage our kernel build
    capacity using VMs from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. We
    expect to roll this out over the next month or two.</li>
  <li>modernization of CI/CD pipelines (e.g. container-centric tools like
    <a href="https://tekton.dev/">Tekton</a>)</li>
  <li>re-factoring and upgrading codebase and tooling to python3</li>
  <li>improving tools to become more generic and reusable in other projects
    doing Kernel CI</li>
  <li>modernizing the UI / UX</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few highlights, and we have many more ideas, but things move
  slow since we are a very small team of active developers. If you have any
  interest in helping in any of these areas, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Building on all the great progress above, we are now gearing up for more
  collaboration and discussions as part of the testing and fuzzing
  microconference at Linux Plumbers Conference this August. The KernelCI project
  will be actively participating in the microconference as we aim to bring our
  tools to more developers, listen to feedback on some of our new ideas and
  directions, and make decisions on future directions.</p>

<h3>Getting involved</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot be involved directly at Linux Plumbers, there are many
  other ways to be involved in the discussion.</p>
