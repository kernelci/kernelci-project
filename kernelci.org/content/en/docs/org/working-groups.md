Working groups are small teams of people focusing on a particular aspect of the
project.  Each group typically relies on a monthly meeting and a GitHub
workboard to keep track of things.

## Web dashboard

As KernelCI keeps growing, and based on the results of the [2020 Community
Survey](http://localhost:1313/blog/posts/2020/07/09/), a new web dashboard is
necessary in order to achieve the goals set by the project.  Several attempts
have been made in the past to replace the current one on
[linux.kernelci.org](https://linux.kernelci.org) but none of them actually
provided a viable alternative.  We've since started gathering ideas from a
range of users in order to produce user stories and get a clear understanding
of what is required.  Based on this, we'll then be looking for technical
solutions including existing frameworks, dashboards used by other projects and
potentially a new design from scratch using modern web technology.
