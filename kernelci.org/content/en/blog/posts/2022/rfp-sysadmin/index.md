  Request for Proposal for KernelCI sysadmin maintenance
---

## Summary

The KernelCI project relies on a number of web services which need constant
maintenance.  These include databases, automation tools and web dashboards for
several instances.  Some are hosted on dedicated virtual machines (VMs), others
in the cloud.  This Request for Proposals seeks to extend the current team with
dedicated sysadmins to ensure the maintenance of these services is being
carried out to guarantee a good quality of service.  Additionally, some
improvements can be made to reduce the maintenance burden.

## Budget

We’re expecting quotations for this work package to range between 15,000 and
30,000 USD depending on the contents of the proposal and for a period of six
months. Longer sysadmin time available and extra improvements can justify a
higher price.  Payments would be made via the Linux Foundation using the
project’s own budget.

## Sending proposals

Please take a look at the full
[RFP-Sysadmin-Maintenance-2022-v3.pdf](RFP-Sysadmin-Maintenance-2022-v3.pdf)
document for all the details. Proposals should be sent by email directly to the
[project members](mailto:kernelci-members@groups.io).

The deadline for responding to this RFP is **8th August 2022**, six weeks after
it has been made public. Then the KernelCI Advisory Board of Members will vote
on the **24th August 2022**. Exact dates might be subject to change in case of
a major practical issue or unavailability of voting members.
