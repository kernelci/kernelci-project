KernelCI will be attending [Linux Plumber’s Conference](https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/)
(LPC) online next week. We will be participating in the
[Testing and Fuzzing micro-conference](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/page/80-accepted-microconferences#tf-cr),
and leading a few discussion topics around automated kernel testing and
reporting in the broader kernel community.

Some topics we’ll be discussing:

* Collecting test results from different kernel testing systems into a shared
data-store for common reporting
* Metrics for success: how do we know if our testing is actually useful?
* Integration of kselftest, Kunit LTP into KernelCI
* Other recent achievements and next steps for the project

The Testing & Fuzzing micro-conference will be on Wednesday, Aug 26 from 7am to
11am (US Pacific) online, and the [full schedule is now available](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/sessions/80/#20200826).
