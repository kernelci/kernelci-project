Working groups are small teams of people focusing on a particular aspect of the
project.  Each group typically relies on a monthly meeting and a GitHub
workboard to keep track of things.

## Web dashboard

As KernelCI keeps growing, and based on the results of the [2020 Community
Survey](http://localhost:1313/blog/posts/2020/07/09/), a new web dashboard is
necessary in order to achieve the goals set by the project.  Several attempts
have been made in the past to replace the current one on
[linux.kernelci.org](https://linux.kernelci.org) but none of them actually
provided a viable alternative.  We've since started gathering ideas from a
range of users in order to produce user stories and get a clear understanding
of what is required.  Based on this, we'll then be looking for technical
solutions including existing frameworks, dashboards used by other projects and
potentially a new design from scratch using modern web technology.

## Sysadmin

The KernelCI common infrastructure requires some regular maintenance to keep
web servers, databases and Cloud services up and running.  This does not
include any test lab other than some Kubernetes clusters as hardware platforms
are maintained by separate companies and individuals.  Members of the sysadmin
working group have admin rights on most of the KernelCI systems, wherever
applicable.  This group has a large overlap with [service
maintainers](tsc/#service-maintainers), it's merely a way to facilitate
operations and ensure maintenance is taking place.
