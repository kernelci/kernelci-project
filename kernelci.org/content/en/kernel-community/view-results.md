description: "Describe ways to interact with the KernelCI test results"
---

The Kernel Community has a few options to interact with the test results available in the KernelCI. Remember this data includes results from several CI systems.

* [**Web Dashboard**](https://dashboard.kernelci.org/)(WIP): Our new Web Dashboard aims at providing an easy way for the community to look at the test results. It is still under development and we are open to your [feedback and feature requests](https://github.com/kernelci/dashboard).
* [**Grafana**](https://grafana.kernelci.org/): Our Grafana instance allow users to create specific dashboard with tailored queries and boards. Those who want to dive deeper into their data can engage with our Grafana instance.
* **Email reports**: [KCIDB](../../kcidb) allows users to create tailored email reports through [templates](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/tree/main/kcidb/templates). Email reports are sent to [kernelci-results@groups.io](https://groups.io/g/kernelci-results) and can also be sent to custom Cc email address.

We know that the documentation above may not answer all your questions. We are working to improve it. We ask you to reach out to our mailing list at [kernelci@lists.linux.dev](mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev)  with questions and feedback. We are eager to hear from you!
