The Advisory Board (AB) is composed of one representative from each premium
member organization, one representative for every five general member
organizations (maximum of three) and the TSC Chair.

By the end of December each year, the Board agrees on a budget for the next
year and submits it to the Linux Foundation.  It then elects a Chair, a
Treasurer and a General Members representative for the following year.  The new
roles and budget take effect on January 1st.

In addition to the elected roles, there is also an appointed Project Manager to
help coordinate activities with the TSC, working groups and the wider team.

As of 2024, the Advisory Board is composed of the members listed below with
their respective roles, email address and IRC nicknames:

## Key Roles

As a matter of transparency and to ensure long-term continuity of operation,
some key roles for the Board are defined below.  These are based on the Funding
Charter as well as various contracts and other agreements to reflect the status
quo.

### Chair

As per the Funding Charter provided by the Linux Foundation:

> The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board, manage any
> day-to-day operational decisions, and will submit minutes for Governing Board
> approval.

Then in the particular case of KernelCI, past discussions have led the Board to
agree on the following responsibilities:

* Plan and execute on the project's initiatives autonomously
* Drive the AB and TSC to help reach the strategic priorities of the project
* Encourage strong engagement and community participation
* Explore relationships with industry alliances to increase the project's reach
* Participate in the community to help foster adoption and collaboration

  companies

* Devise and deliver visibility for the project at key conferences and events
* Attend conferences and organize speaking engagements at relevant events

### Treasurer

> The Treasurer will assist in the preparation of budgets for Governing Board
> approval, monitor expenses against the budget and authorize expenditures
> approved in the budget.

The specifics for KernelCI are not further detailed but typically include
liaising with the Linux Foundation for any finance-related business such as
setting up contracts and dealing with invoices.

### Project Manager

by KernelCI board members with the following responsibilities:

* Manage the day-to-day activities for the project (both AB and TSC efforts)

They are all expected to cast a vote and take part in the Board meetings to
take initiatives and help the project thrive.
