The Kernel Community is the audience of KernelCI. Upstream maintainers and developers, product makers, hardware vendors, etc. are all interested in getting the kernel tested on a variety of scenarios.

> This documentation is still a **WIP**. As we ready new KernelCI for more users the documentation is being improved and expanded.

This section of the documentation shares instructions to:
* [enable kernel testing for your tree/branch](../maestro/pipeline/developer-documentation/#enabling-a-new-kernel-tree)
* [enable specific tests](../maestro/pipeline/developer-documentation/#enabling-a-new-test)
* visualize the results(TBD)

We know that the documentation above may not answer all your questions. We are working to improve it. We ask you to reach out to our mailing list at [kernelci@lists.linux.dev](mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev)  with questions and feedback. We are eager to hear from you!
