<p>During the past year we’ve been working on a way to bring reports from all
the separate kernel testing systems together. Our aim is to send a single report
email to kernel developers when testing results are ready, and to provide a
single go-to place to view them.</p>

<p>For that purpose we needed a unified schema and a submission protocol which
all the testing systems could use to submit their reports, including the
existing kernelci.org service itself. Below is an introduction to the third
version of the schema and the protocol, based on our close cooperation with Red
Hat’s CKI Project, and discussions with maintainers of other testing systems,
such as <a href="https://01.org/lkp/documentation/0-day-test-service">0-Day</a>
and <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/">syzbot</a>. It is currently used to
aggregate results from both kernelci.org and CKI, present them on
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/">the prototype dashboard</a>, and
send proof-of-concept notifications to a
<a href="https://groups.io/g/kernelci-results-staging/search?q=%22+failed+for+%22">staging maillist</a>.
The development is ongoing in a
<a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/">GitHub repository</a>, and we would
like to invite requirements from more testing systems, so we can accommodate
their data too.</p>

<h2>The Schema</h2>
<p>We chose JSON as our data format, and created
<a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/releases/download/v6/kcidb.v3.0.schema.json">a single schema</a>
to hold any type of the accepted report data, in any combination. The only
required data item is the schema version, so the minimum (no-effect) submission
would be:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise the report can include "revisions", "builds", and "tests"; objects,
in any amount or combination, stored in arrays under correspondingly-named
keys:</p>

<img src="kcidb_object_relations.svg" alt="kcidb object relations" width="80%">

<p>Each of the objects has only the minimal number of structural fields
required:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "revisions": [
        {
            "id": "84780c5438efd96cfd27fc0d7722aee3b3fe44e6",
            "origin": "kernelci"
        }
    ],
    "builds": [
        {
            "id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01d0d9625b0a76b8c6d9a",
            "origin": "kernelci",
            "revision_id": "84780c5438efd96cfd27fc0d7722aee3b3fe44e6"
        },
        {
            "id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01f18d90ac282ea8c6d6a",
            "origin": "kernelci",
            "revision_id": "84780c5438efd96cfd27fc0d7722aee3b3fe44e6"
        }
    ],
    "tests": [
        {
            "id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01da0f17c85a0878c6d6c",
            "origin": "kernelci",
            "build_id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01d0d9625b0a76b8c6d9a"
        },
        {
            "id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01da0f17c85a0878c6d6e",
            "origin": "kernelci",
            "build_id": "kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ee01d0d9625b0a76b8c6d9a"
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The minimal number of required fields makes it easier for the submitters to
start sending their reports, since they don’t need to extract much data from
their systems, and lets them increase their involvement and contribution
gradually.</p>

<p>The object “id” fields are used to link builds to revisions and tests to
builds, and are generated by the submitter, who is responsible for ensuring
their IDs are unique across the objects they submit. Database-wide uniqueness is
ensured by prepending the submitter’s name (“origin”) to the IDs, with the
exception of revisions, which IDs are used to correlate results for the same
revisions across submitters.</p>

<p>Linked objects don’t have to appear in the same submissions and can be sent
separately. This allows for gradual reporting of long-running tests. E.g. first
revisions, when they’re discovered and building is started, then builds as they
finish, and then tests as they complete. However, the order could be reversed as
well. The data is only considered for reporting when it makes sense and is
sufficient.</p>

<img src="kcidb_object_submitting.gif" alt="kcidb object submitting" width="80%">

<p>Finally, the "origin" field allows identifying the testing system which
submitted the report to help with debugging, and reporting testing bugs.</p>

<h3>Revision</h3>
<p>A "revision" object represents a version of the kernel code and describes a
way it could be obtained. A commit in a git repo:</p>

<img src="revision1.png" alt="commit revision" width="80%">

<p>could be detected by Red Hat's CKI (referred to in "origin") and
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/revision/revision?orgId=1&amp;var-id=11a48a5a18c63fd7621bb050228cebf13566e4d8">reported</a>
as such:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "revisions": [
        {
            "id": "11a48a5a18c63fd7621bb050228cebf13566e4d8",
            "origin": "redhat",
            "git_repository_url": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/.../rdma.git",
            "git_repository_branch": "for-rc",
            "git_commit_hash": "11a48a5a18c63fd7621bb050228cebf13566e4d8",
            "discovery_time": "2020-02-18T15:50:56.526000+00:00",
            "valid": true
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Commit revisions are identified by their commit hash. This one describes a
commit in the "for-rc" branch of the "rdma" tree. The "discovery_time" field
contains the time at which the submitter noticed it.</p>

<p>A patchset:</p>

<img src="patched_revision2.png" alt="patched revision" width="80%">

<p>Could be reported like this:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "revisions": [
        {
            "id": "391e437eedc0dab0a9f2c26997e68e040ae04ea3+88b9f263362...e871d8195d777c",

            "git_commit_hash": "391e437eedc0dab0a9f2c26997e68e040ae04ea3",
            "git_repository_branch": "stm32-next",
            "patch_mboxes": [
                {
                    "name": "0001-irqchip-stm32-exti-map-direct-event-to-irq-parent.patch",
                    "url": "https://github.com/0day-ci/linux/commit/3f47dd3217f24e.patch"
                }
            ],
            "message_id": "20200706081106.25125-1-alexandre.torgue@st.com",
            "contacts": [
                "Alexandre Torgue <alexandre.torgue@st.com>",
                "kbuild-all <kbuild-all@lists.01.org>",
                "Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>",
                "Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>",
                "Jason Cooper <jason@lakedaemon.net>",
                "LKML <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>"
            ],
            "valid": true
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This one describes a single-patch patchset on top of a commit in the
"stm32-next"; branch of the "stm32" tree. This is a theoretical submission
corresponding to
<a href="https://lists.01.org/hyperkitty/list/kbuild-all@lists.01.org/thread/GUFRHHPKTWFYNLRH4LE2E2YELI6XG2IE/">a report from Intel's 0-day system</a>.
The "patch_mboxes" field contains links to patchset's patches in the
application order. The "message_id" field is the Message-ID header of the
maillist message representing the patchset (e.g. the cover message, or the
message with the last patch). The "contacts" array lists email addresses of
contacts concerned with the revision, e.g. all the recipients from the patchset
messages.</p>

<p>Finally, the "valid" field could be "false" in case the patches didn't apply,
which could be reported as a reply to the message in "message_id" with
recipients from "contacts", for example.</p>

<p>Patchset revisions are identified by a string containing the base commit
hash, a "+" character, and a sha256 hash over sha256 hashes of patches in order,
e.g. produced by "sha256sum *.patch | cut -c-64 | sha256sum | cut -c-64".</p>

<h3>Builds</h3>
<p>A "build" object represents an (attempted) build of the code described by the
linked "revision" object. As mentioned above, only the absolute minimum
structural fields are required for all objects, but here's a (somewhat
abbreviated) example of a
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/build/build?orgId=1&amp;var-id=kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5ef1b0a2cf22a40215533477">successful build</a>
submitted by KernelCI:</p>

<pre><code>

    "builds": [

                },
                {
                    "name": "kernel_image",
                    "url": "https://storage.staging.kernelci.org/.../gcc-8/bzImage"
                },
                {
                    "name": "modules",
                    "url": "https://storage.staging.kernelci.org/.../gcc-8/modules.tar.xz"
                }
            ],
            "start_time": "2020-06-23T07:34:58.704000+00:00",
            "valid": true
        },
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This build report has the architecture, compiler, and the kernel
configuration specified (both the name and the file), it also says when it was
started and how long it took to complete, has the output log attached, and
finally has several output files including the kernel image, the modules and the
"System.map" file.</p>

<p>Here's how a
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/build/build?orgId=1&amp;var-id=redhat:721904">failed build</a>
could be reported by CKI:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "builds": [
        {
            "id": "redhat:721904",
            "origin": "redhat",
            "revision_id": "e9842f9e58e1597ad62a7c899e7460bb861d9485",
            "architecture": "aarch64",
            "command": "make -j30 INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 targz-pkg",
            "compiler": "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat Cross 9.2.1-1)",
            "config_name": "fedora",
            "log_url": "https://cki-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/.../497202/build_aarch64.log",
            "start_time": "2020-03-20T10:51:39.425000+00:00",
            "valid": false
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This has less data compared to the kernelci.org one, in part because it
failed (so has no output), and in part because CKI records less build
information. However, it specifies the build command, and of course marks the
build as failed with "valid" being set to "false".</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>A "test" object describes a test executed in a certain environment on the
"build" it links to. Here's an example of a
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/test/test?orgId=1&amp;var-id=redhat:113555631">successful test run</a>
submitted by Red Hat's CKI:</p>

<pre><code>
{
    "tests": [
        {
            "id": "redhat:113555631",
            "origin": "redhat",
            "build_id": "redhat:942598",
            "path": "ltp",
            "description": "LTP",
            "start_time": "2020-07-23T04:06:52+00:00",
            "duration": 6827.0,
            "output_files": [
                {
                    "name": "8598136_x86_64_4_console.log",
                    "url": "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/.../8598136_x86_64_4_console.log"
                },
                {
                    "name": "8598136_x86_64_4_resultoutputfile.log",
                    "url": "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/...x86_64_4_resultoutputfile.log"
                },
                {
                    "name": "8598136_x86_64_4_dmesg.log",
                    "url": "https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/.../8598136_x86_64_4_dmesg.log"
                }
            ],
            "status": "PASS",
            "waived": false
        }
    ],
    "version": {
        "major": 3,
        "minor": 0
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an execution of the
<a href="https://linux-test-project.github.io/">LTP test suite</a>, and the
report includes the time and the duration of the test, as well as links to
output files. It also includes the resulting test status as "PASS". There are
four more statuses accepted: "FAIL", "ERROR", "DONE", and "SKIP". The report
also includes the "waived" flag set to "false", which says the report should not
be ignored when summarizing the testing results for the build. Setting "waived"
to "true" is useful when you're just introducing the test, or fixing an issue
with it, and cannot trust it, but want it to still produce results, so that you
could see how it's doing and accumulate statistics.</p>

<p>Finally, the report includes the "path" field, which is used to identify the
particular test or test suite, and optionally parts of it. We support both
submitters who can only report results for a whole test suite, and those who can
report each of its parts. The whole LTP test suite could be reported as "ltp",
and its" signal06" test case could be reported as "ltp.signal06". We maintain a
<a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/blob/master/tests.yaml">catalogue</a>
of agreed-upon top-level names. A submitter is not required to use those, or use
any at all. However, using agreed-upon names is beneficial to both kernel
developers and submitters, as it allows correlating results of the same test
coming from different CI systems.</p>

<p>We are still working on how to best describe "environments" the tests are
executed in, so that test results could be correlated across similar hardware,
and this report is not including any environment information. However, below is
a <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/test/test?orgId=1&amp;var-id=kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5f169b9d55fe5e789f6383d7">failed test report</a>

<h3>More Data</h3>
<p>Our schema is constantly evolving, some fields are added, renamed, or
removed. To help with deciding what changes we need, and to help submitters
reach developers with their specific data before we can fully and properly
accommodate it, each major object in the schema accepts a special field called
"misc", containing arbitrary objects.</p>

<p>The submitters can use these fields to add data they want to see in the
database, and to give developers sooner. For example, see a
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/build/build?orgId=1&amp;var-id=kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5f193c2781b163bf04cae331">build</a>
and a <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/test/test?orgId=1&amp;var-id=kernelci:staging.kernelci.org:5f193d31fd2688f41ccae331">test</a>
with extra data added by kernelci.org. The "misc" fields are also useful for
debugging. E.g. see how Red Hat's CKI is using them to link a
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/revision/revision?orgId=1&amp;var-id=d15be546031cf65a0fc34879beca02fd90fe7ac7&amp;var-dataset=kernelci04&amp;var-origin=redhat">revision</a>,
a <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/build/build?orgId=1&amp;var-id=redhat:942630">build</a>,
and a <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/test/test?orgId=1&amp;var-id=redhat:113552177">test run</a>
to internal objects.</p>

<h2>The Protocol</h2>
<p>If your report JSON complies with the schema, then all you need to do is send
it over to us. There's no handshake, synchronization, or object ID allocation.
To send it you need to specify an authentication key and the destination, both
of which we supply you with. Contact us at
<a href="mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev">kernelci@lists.linux.dev</a>, or the
#kernelci channel on <a href="https://freenode.net/">freenode.net</a> to get
yours. You can use either the command-line tool, or the Python 3 library to
submit your reports.</p>

<p>In practice, a command-line submission could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.kernelci-production-ci-cki.json
$ kcidb-submit -p kernelci-production -t kernelci_new < report.json
</code></pre>

<p>A Python 3 submission code could look like this (using
"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS" from the environment):</p>

<pre><code>
from kcidb import Client
client = Client(project_id="kernelci-production", topic_name="kernelci_new")
client.submit(report)
</code></pre>

<p>Where "report" would be the standard Python representation of the JSON data.</p>



<p>After you've sent the data, you only need to make sure the URLs you submitted
inside reports stay valid for an acceptable time, and that if you submit further
linked objects, they use the IDs you sent.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>We're working on correlating results between different submitters:
identifying and joining revisions, builds, test environments, and test runs.
We're improving the dashboard, as far as possible with Grafana, and looking for
another implementation beyond that. Finally, we're working on the emails
notifying the developers of the results we collect, beyond the POC we already
have.</p>

<h2>How to help</h2>
<p>Send us your kernel testing reports, and volunteer to receive email
notifications, join the development, share your ideas and report bugs! Write to
<a href="mailto:kernelci@lists.linux.dev">kernelci@lists.linux.dev</a> if you
want to help!</p>
