## Native tests

KernelCI native tests are orchestrated by KernelCI.  They are initiated in test
labs directly connected to KernelCI and results are visible on the [web
frontend](https://linux.kernelci.org/job/).

Tests run natively by KernelCI such as [kselftest](kselftest) and [LTP](ltp)
but also some KernelCI specific ones are all described with dedicated pages
under this current section.

It's possible for anyone to add new native tests.  See the [How-To
guide](howto) to get started.

## External tests and KCIDB

Non-native tests are run in fully autonomous systems, such as syzbot or CKI.
Their results are shared alongside KernelCI native test results via
[KCIDB](https://kcidb.kernelci.org).

See the [Tests Catalog](https://github.com/kernelci/kcidb/blob/main/tests.yaml)
file with the list of test identifiers used by KCIDB.
