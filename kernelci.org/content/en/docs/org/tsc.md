The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a team of people who are responsible
for keeping the KernelCI project in a good shape and driving its development.
The [rules](#rules) are based on the LF [project
charter](/files/KernelCI_Project_Technical_Charter_20181107.pdf).  Typically,
major contributors eventually become members and those who have stopped
contributing for an extended period of time may be removed.  This is done in
agreement with the TSC and the AB.  The TSC may vote to make decisions when
there is no consensus or when a formal procedure is required.

## Members

As of today, the committee is composed of the members listed below with their
respective email address and IRC nicknames:

* [Kevin Hilman](mailto:<khilman@baylibre.com>) - `khilman`
* [Mark Brown](mailto:<broonie@kernel.org>) - `broonie`
* [Guillaume Tucker](mailto:<guillaume.tucker@collabora.com>) - `gtucker`
* [Corentin Labbe](mailto:<clabbe@baylibre.com>) - `montjoie`
* [Nikolai Kondrashov](mailto:<spbnick@gmail.com>) - `spbnick`
* [Michał Gałka](mailto:<michal.galka@collabora.com>) - `mgalka`
* [Alexandra Pereira](mailto:<alexandra.pereira@collabora.com>) - `apereira`
* [Alice Ferrazzi](mailto:<alice.ferrazzi@miraclelinux.com>) - `alicef`
* [Denys Fedoryshchenko](mailto:<denys.f@collabora.com>) - `nuclearcat`

## Communication

For general discussions, the usual IRC channel `#kernelci` on libera.chat and
the [`kernelci@lists.linux.dev`](mailto:<kernelci@lists.linux.dev>) mailing
list can be used.  To contact only the TSC members directly, the
[`kernelci-tsc@groups.io`](mailto:<kernelci-tsc@groups.io>) private list may be
used instead.

The TSC also meet monthly online to discuss current topics and make decisions
including votes when necessary.

## Rules

### Votes

Most decisions are reached by consensus and don't require a vote.  Decisions
that always require a vote are when adding or removing TSC members and making
proposals to the board.  The results of the votes should be archived and as
such they provide a way to keep a formal trace of decisions being made.

> *Note* The archiving process for TSC votes hasn't been formalised yet.  Past
> votes should be retroactively archived when this has been put in place.  They
> should appear in a sub-section of this documentation section.

Conditions for making a successful vote and determining its outcome are defined
in the [project
charter](/files/KernelCI_Project_Technical_Charter_20181107.pdf) in section
*3. TSC Voting*.  Votes done in a live meeting require 50% of the TSC to be
voting and a majority among the members attending.  Votes done by email or
other deferred channel require a majority among all of the TSC members.

### Members

Current members of the TSC may suggest new people to be added.  This should
then go through a vote to keep a trace of it and prevent a single organisation
from taking over the TSC.

Likewise, members of the TSC may suggest that a member be removed which should
result in a vote.  Members who have not been active for over a year should be
notified and considered for removal from TSC in order to keep the list
up-to-date with the reality of the project.  Active members are typically
expected to:

* attend meetings (monthly)
* participate in votes
* make some form of positive contribution to the project
