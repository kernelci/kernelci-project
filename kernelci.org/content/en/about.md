> KernelCI is a community-based open source distributed test automation system focused on upstream kernel development.

The primary goal of KernelCI is to use an open testing philosophy to ensure the quality, stability and long-term maintenance of the Linux kernel.

The Project is currently working on improving LTS kernel testing and validation; consolidation of existing testing initiatives; quality-of-life improvements to the current service; expanded compute resources; and increased pool of hardware to be tested.

The Linux kernel is developed by a large, collaborative open source community working together to continuously improve the software. Conversely, Linux kernel testing has often fragmented since it is largely done in private silos with little collaboration on the testing software or methodologies. Because Linux runs on more hardware than any other operating system, itâ€™s important to test it on the most hardware possible. KernelCI standardizes hardware testing for the Linux kernel across the broadest possible hardware.

KernelCI was originally started in 2014 as a side project by a few engineers (Tyler Baker,Alan Bennett, Milo Casagrande, Kevin Hilman) who were doing the testing at home and in their spare time. A variety of hardware labs contributed to the work over time, but until now there was no sustainable structure in place for open governance and contribution, or expanded access for the developers to hardware. Today, under the Linux Foundation, companies and individuals can contribute to expanding testing and integration across more hardware than ever before.
