  KernelCI User Experience Analysis

Following the [UX Analysis RFP](/blog/posts/2023/rfp-ux-analysis/) we shared a
few months ago, we're now delighted to announce that the KernelCI Advisory
Board has accepted a proposal.  First of all, we're grateful to have received
such a series of high-quality proposals.  Many thanks once again to all the
submitters for your interest in the project.

After carefully considering all the options with the board and some TSC
members, the vote came out in favour of
[ProFUSION](https://profusion.mobi/index-en.html).  Congratulations!  We're
looking forward to the next milestones, in fact the work has already started.

## Milestones

The UX Analysis project is broken down into three milestones with four weeks
assigned to each, so a total of twelve weeks.  Some breaks will also be
scheduled during this time so the calendar end date is likely to be in March
2024.

### M1: Result of interviews

Some interviews will be carried out with various stakeholders to help refine
user stories and start modelling the user experience and some design aspects.

### M2: First UX design proposal

A first interactive prototype will then be created and made available for
members of the public to evaluate and provide feedback.

### M3: Final UX design proposal

Based on the feedback and outcome of the first two milestones, the last part is
about creating high-level specifications of the web dashboard design suitable
for the implementation phase.
