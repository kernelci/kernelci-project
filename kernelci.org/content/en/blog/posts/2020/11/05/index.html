<p>The <a href="https://osseu2020.sched.com/">OSS/ELC Europe 2020</a> conference
took place online from 26th to 28th October. There was one BoF session and one
talk about KernelCI, followed by an impromptu video call. The notes below were
gathered based on these events.</p>

<h2>BoF: Lessons Learned</h2>
<h4>Guillaume Tucker, Collabora</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot has happened since KernelCI was announced as a new Linux Foundation
     project at ELC-E 2019 in Lyon. One year on, what have we learnt?</p>

for slides and more details. Below are a list of Q&amp;A gathered from the
session.</p>


<p><strong>Q: I wonder if you plan to add any subsystem-specific CI? Are there
any plans/ideas? e.g. for scsi drivers</strong></p>

<p>There are already subsystem-specific tests being run, and subsystem branches
can be monitored. Then results can be sent to subsystem mailing lists. For
example, this is the case with v4l2: kernelci.org runs v4l2-compliance on a
number of platforms for several branches including the media tree, mainline,
stable and linux-next, and sends reports with regressions.</p>

<p>There should not be any subsystem-specific infrastructure needed on
kernelci.org, but rather different tests and maybe different parameters to
adjust to the workflows according to maintainers‚Äô needs.</p>


<p><strong>Q: Some time ago there was a way to search for test runs in a
specific lab. I mean on the dashboard. But it seems this feature is gone now.
Was that intended? Is it coming back? Can we help and contribute here? üôÇ</strong></p>

<p>The web frontend was scaled down to accommodate for functional testing rather
than boot testing. This was because all the boot testing search pages were
tailor-made, which doesn‚Äôt scale very well and is very hard to maintain.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre now looking into a fresh web dashboard design with flexible search
features to be able to do that. As a first step, we are collecting user stories.
If you have any, such as ‚ÄúI want to find out all the test results for the
devices in my lab‚Äù, feel free to reply to this thread:

"RFC: dashboards, visualization and analytics for test results"</p>


<p><strong>Q: What is the relationship between KernelCI project and LAVA
project? Does KernelCI have non-upstream changes to LAVA? Do LAVA people
participate in KernelCI?</strong></p>

<p>LAVA is used in many test labs that provide results to KernelCI, but KernelCI
doesn‚Äôt run any labs itself. Some people do contribute to both, as KernelCI is
one of the biggest public use-cases of LAVA, but they really are independent
projects. The core KernelCI tools are designed to facilitate working with LAVA
labs, but this is not a requirement and other test lab frameworks are also used.</p>


<p><strong>Q: Is there any documentation on how to write those "custom" tests
and to integrate it with KernelCI? (e.g. the SCSI drivers/storage devices you
just mention before)</strong></p>

<p>See Khouloud Touils‚Äô talk
<a href="https://osseu2020.sched.com/event/eCNl/lets-test-with-kernelci-khouloud-touil-baylibre">Let‚Äôs Test with KernelCI</a>
with some hands-on examples.</p>

<p>There is also the user guide as part of the KernelCI documentation:
<br><a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/doc/kci_testsuite.md">https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/blob/master/doc/kci_testsuite.md</a></p>

<p>Each test is a bit different as they all have their own dependencies and are
written in various languages. Typically, they will require a user-space image
with all the required packages installed to be able to run as well as the latest
versions of some test suites built from source. This is the case with v4l-utils,
igt-gpu-tools or LTP. Some are plain scripts and don‚Äôt depend on anything in
particular, such as bootrr.</p>

<p>When prototyping some new tests to run in LAVA, the easiest approach is to
use nfsroot with the plain Debian Buster image provided by KernelCI and install
extra packages at runtime, before starting the tests. Then when this is working
well, dependencies and any data files can be baked into a fixed rootfs image for
performance and reproducibility.</p>


<p><strong>Q: How to properly deal with boards which are able to boot only from
a mass-storage device and prevent them from being stuck with a non-working
image?</strong></p>

<p>In order to be useful with KernelCI, it‚Äôs required to at least be able to
dynamically load the kernel image as well as any modules and device tree with a
ramdisk for the tests that fit in a small enough image. If this can‚Äôt be done,
then the kernel and user-space images need to be written to the persistent
storage before each job. It might also be possible to load the kernel over TFTP
and then extract the image onto the persistent storage and use it as a chroot.
Ultimately this is the lab‚Äôs responsibility and it will depend on many things.
If the kernel and the user-space can‚Äôt be changed at all, or if there is a
possibility of bricking the device, then it‚Äôs basically not practical to do any
CI on such a platform.</p>


<h2>Let‚Äôs Test with KernelCI</h2>
<h4>Khouloud Touil, Baylibre</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A growing number of Linux developers want to use KernelCI to run their test
     suites, but there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve for how to make test suites
     work with KernelCI. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Test with KernelCI‚Äù will give an overview of the
     ways to integrate test suites and/or test results into the KernelCI modular
     pipeline.</p>

<p>See the full
<a href="https://osseu2020.sched.com/event/eCNl/lets-test-with-kernelci-khouloud-touil-baylibre">Event description</a>
for more details. Below are a list of Q&A gathered from the session.</p>


<p><strong>Q: Is there also support for custom YP/OE distros or is it currently
limited to the usage of predefined kernels and file systems?</strong></p>

<p>The kernels are all built with regular "make", not any packaging or yocto
recipe is supported right now. However, that could be done with a bit of
plumbing. Then for user-space, kernelci only really tests the kernel: the
buildroot and debian images are only there to be able to run kernel tests. If
you create your own KernelCI instance, you can run tests with your own
user-space built using Yocto and extend testing to cover some user-space if you
want.</p>


<p><strong>Q: Is there some kind of test config to require a certain kernel flag
active? I am basically thinking about running some pre-defined test base, based
on my own kernel config and then report back the results with something like
"ran test X, which requires kernel config flag Y, on architecture/platform Z on
kernel version V".</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there are a couple of ways to adjust the kernel config on kernelci.org.
One way is with a special syntax like defconfig+CONFIG_SOMETHING=y. Another way
is to define a config fragment. Each KernelCI test result will have the
information you mentioned as meta-data.</p>


<p><strong>Q: Which firewall streams must be permitted in order for KernelCI to
use a custom Lab? I mean if we want to contribute a lab (with associated boards)
to KernelCI.org?</strong></p>

<p>LAVA exposes a REST API over HTTPS. It‚Äôs also possible to have the LAVA
server hosted publicly and using LAVA dispatchers in a private network which
will be connecting to the server as clients, with no incoming connections.</p>

<p>When not using LAVA, you can also periodically poll storage.kernelci.org for
new kernel builds to appear, and download them to test them then send results to
api.kernelci.org. In this case, no incoming connections are required either.</p>


<p><strong>Q: In real life how are tests that need to check hardware I/O done?
For example in your audio playback case it's probably not enough to run the play
command but we want to check that something was actually played e.g. by
capturing the output</strong>.</p>

<p>For audio (and video), some hardware has loopback devices which can be used
to compare against expected output. For more advanced setup, labs can have
external capture equipment as well. But this ends up to be lab-specific since
there are many ways to do it.</p>


<h2>Follow-up impromptu video discussion</h2>
<p>As we neared the end of the time slot for the "Let's Test with KernelCI"
talk, we decided to start a public video call with anyone who was interested and
attended the talk. We discussed various general things about the project, and a
few notes and Q&A were captured:</p>


<p><strong>Q: How can a test lab get added to kernelci.org?</strong></p>
<p>This is something that would require better documentation. We can distinguish
3 different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of integration for labs:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>LAVA-style: fully integrated into the pipeline</strong><br>
    If you have a LAVA lab, it‚Äôs the easiest way to contribute test results to
    KernelCI. It also enables automated bisection and is the most efficient way
    of getting tests run.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous test lab</strong><br>
    If you have a test lab with no way to receive requests to run tests, you can
    look for kernelci.org builds to appear and submit results with kci_data. A
    typical example is Labgrid. One way to improve this is to implement some
    notification protocol so these labs could avoid polling and get requests to
    run tests like the LAVA labs.</li>
  <li><strong>Autonomous CI system: KCIDB</strong><br>
    With options 1 and 2, tests use kernel builds from kernelci.org and report
    results to the same backend. This is called the "native" KernelCI tests.
    Option 3 is for full CI systems creating their own kernel builds and running
    their own set of tests. The results are sent to the common reporting
    database using the KCIDB tools.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Q: Where can we find the source and definition of tests visible on
kernelci.org frontend?</strong></p>

<p>This is also something that would require better documentation, with a
directory of all the test plans and how they are created. Functional tests are
fairly recent on kernelci.org, which is why we don‚Äôt have that yet.</p>

<p>All the tests are normally defined in the
<a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/">kernelci-core</a>
repository. This includes building some test suites from source and including
them in user-space rootfs images, and defining how to run the tests.</p>


<p><strong>User story: Checking results for devices in "my" lab across all the
branches and revisions.</strong></p>
