<p>The <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference 2020</a>
was held as a virtual event this year. The online platform provided a really
good experience, with talks and live discussions using
<a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> for the video and
<a href="https://rocket.chat/">Rocket Chat</a> for text-based discussions.
KernelCI was mentioned many times in several micro-conferences, with two talks
in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9Glc90WUN0&amp;list=PLVsQ_xZBEyN1HgWTOCn2Q96Q-RyfBSdKs&amp;index=18">Testing & Fuzzing</a>
which are now available on YouTube:</p>

  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/y9Glc90WUN0?list=PLVsQ_xZBEyN1HgWTOCn2Q96Q-RyfBSdKs&amp;t=10744">Unifying Test Reporting with KernelCI</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The notes below were gathered publicly from a number of attendees, they give
a good insight into what was discussed. In short, while there is still a lot to
be done, the KernelCI project is healthy and growing well in its role of a
central CI system for the upstream Linux kernel.</p>

<h2>Real-Time Linux</h2>
<p>We’ve been making great progress with running LAVA jobs using the
test-definitions repository from Linaro, thanks to Daniel Wagner’s help in
particular. This was prompted by the discussions in the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHE_3iU9nTs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLVsQ_xZBEyN1HgWTOCn2Q96Q-RyfBSdKs&amp;t=4862">real-time micro-conference</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial GitHub PR: <a href="https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/pull/475">https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-core/pull/475</a></li>
  <li>Results on staging: <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org/test/job/rt-stable_v5.4-rt/branch/HEAD/kernel/v5.4.61-rt37/plan/preempt-rt/">v5.4.61-rt37</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The next steps from a KernelCI infrastructure point of view is to be able to
detect performance regressions, as these are different to binary pass/fail
results. KernelCI can already handle measurements, but not yet compare them to
detect regressions. Real-time getting merged upstream means it is becoming
increasingly important to be able to support this.</p>

<p>There was also an interesting talk about determining the scheduler latency
when using RT_PREEMPT and the introduction of a new tool “rtsl” to trace
real-time latency. This might be an interesting area to investigate and
potentially run automated tests with:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Static Analysis</h2>
<p>The topic of static analysis and CI systems came up during the Kernel
Dependability MC, and in particular, they were looking for a place to do
“common reporting” in order to collect results for the various types of static
analysis and checkers available. We pointed them to the KernelCI common
reporting talks/BoFs.</p>

<p>Some static analysis can also be done by KernelCI “native” tests using the
kernelci.org Cloud infrastructure via Kubernetes, which is currently only used
to build kernels. This is probably where KUnit and devicetree validation will be
run, but the rest still needs to be defined.</p>

<h2>KCIDB</h2>
<h3>Fuego</h3>
<p>Tim Bird, the main developer of <a href="http://fuegotest.org/">Fuego</a> at
SONY, joined the KCIDB BoF and we had a good discussion. Unfortunately he had
not enough time to go through to an actual submission. We got about a quarter
way through converting his mock data to KCIDB.</p>

<h3>Gentoo Kernel CI</h3>
<p>Alice Ferrazzi, maintainer of
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/GKernelCI">GKernelCI</a> at Gentoo, had
more time available for the KCIDB BoF and we talked through getting the data out
of her system. A mockup of her data was made and successfully
<a href="https://staging.kernelci.org:3000/d/revision/revision?orgId=1&amp;var-dataset=playground_kernelci04&amp;var-id=9ece50d8a470ca7235ffd6ac0f9c5f0f201fe2c8%2Bbf3c6a7247ae590c0d2965622961b74b6c99a92fec70d07fa4025cb6fcb944a9">submitted</a>
to the KCIDB playground database setup.</p>

<h3>Intel</h3>
<p>Tim Orling, <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto</a> project
architect at Intel, has expressed keen interest in KCIDB. He said he would
experiment at home and will push Intel internally to participate.</p>

<h2>LLVM/Clang</h2>
<p>The recently added support for "LLVM=1" upstream means we can now have better
support for making Clang builds. In particular, this means we’re now using all
the LLVM binaries and not just clang. It also solved the issue with
merge_config.sh and the default CC=gcc in the top-level Makefile.</p>

<p>This was enabled in kernelci.org shortly after LPC.</p>

<h2>kselftest</h2>
<p>The first kselftest results were produced on staging.kernelci.org during
Plumbers as a collective effort. We have now started enabling them in
production, so stay tuned as they should soon start appearing on
<a href="https://kernelci.org">kernelci.org</a>.</p>

<p>Initial set of results:

<h2>AutoFDO</h2>
<p>AutoFDO will hopefully get merged upstream, once it is it might be useful for
CI systems to share profiling data from benchmarking runs in particular.</p>

<h2>Building randconfig</h2>
<p>The TuxML project carries out some research around Linux kernel builds:
determining the build time, what can be optimised, which configurations are not
valid… The project could benefit from the kernelci.org Cloud infrastructure to
extend its build capacity while also providing more build coverage to
kernelci.org. This could be done by detecting kernel configurations that don’t
build or lead to problems that can’t be found with the regular defconfigs.</p>

<h2>Using tuxmake</h2>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://gitlab.com/Linaro/tuxmake">tuxmake</a> is to
provide a way to reproduce Linux kernel builds in a controlled environment. This
is used primarily by LKFT, but it should be generic enough to cover any use-case
related to building kernels. KernelCI uses its kci_build tool to generate kernel
configurations and produce kernel builds with some associated meta-data. It
could reuse tuxmake to avoid some duplication of effort and only implement the
KernelCI-specific aspects.</p>
