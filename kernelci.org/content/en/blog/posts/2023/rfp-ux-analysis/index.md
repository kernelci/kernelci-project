  Request for Proposal for KernelCI User Experience Analysis
---

The KernelCI project runs thousands of Linux kernel tests every day, generating
a huge amount of data to help the community identify issues and trends. One way
to communicate all this is through a bespoke web application that truly
embodies the kernel community’s use cases. This Request For Proposals (RFP)
aims to be an initial investigation to understand how the User Experience (UX)
of the Web Dashboard could look like based on a set of user stories compiled by
the KernelCI team.

## Budget

We're expecting vendors to submit a fixed-price proposal showing the total
costs for the different phases they plan for the project. Optional or extra
phases can be included as well. The vendors have autonomy to propose a process
for the iterative feedback roadmap.  Payments would be made by the Linux
Foundation using the project’s own budget.

## Sending proposals

Please take a look at the full
[RFP-UX-Analysis-2023-v2.pdf](RFP-UX-Analysis-2023-v2.pdf)
document for all the details. Proposals should be sent by email directly to the
[project members](mailto:kernelci-members@groups.io).

The deadline for responding to this RFP is **10th July 2023**, six weeks after
it has been made public. Then the KernelCI Advisory Board of Members will vote
on the **24th July 2023**. Exact dates might be subject to change in case of a
major practical issue or unavailability of voting members.
