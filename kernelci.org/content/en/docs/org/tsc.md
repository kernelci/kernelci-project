The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a team of people who are responsible
for keeping the KernelCI project in a good shape and driving its development.

The rules for adding or removing members from the TSC are defined in the LF
project [charter](/files/KernelCI_Project_Technical_Charter_20181107.pdf).
Typically, major contributors eventually become members and those who have
stopped contributing for an extended period of time may be removed.  This is
done in agreement with the TSC and the AB.

## Members

As of today, the committee is composed of the members listed below with their
respective email address and IRC nicknames:

* [Kevin Hilman](mailto:<khilman@baylibre.com>) - `khilman`
* [Mark Brown](mailto:<broonie@kernel.org>) - `broonie`

## Communication

For general discussions, the usual IRC channel `#kernelci` on libera.chat and
the [`kernelci@groups.io`](mailto:<kernelci@groups.io>) mailing list can be
used.  To contact only the TSC members directly, the
[`kernelci-tsc@groups.io`](mailto:<kernelci-tsc@groups.io>) private list may be
used instead.

The TSC also meet monthly online to discuss current topics and make decisions
including votes when necessary.
