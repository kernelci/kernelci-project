The KernelCI Linux Foundation project is composed of an [Advisory Board](board)
with representatives from all the member organizations as well as a [Technical
Steering Committee](tsc).

## Mission Statement
To ensure the quality, stability and long-term maintenance of the Linux kernel
by maintaining an open ecosystem around test automation practices and
principles.

### Objective: Maintainer buy-in
Drive for adoption of the project as an integral part of the Linux kernel
development workflow by Linux kernel maintainers.

**Key Results**
* Maintainers require basic CI to pass before reviewing/accepting/merging
* Maintainers require test cases for acceptance of new features running in CI

### Objective: Broad adoption
Promote participation from and adoption by kernel developers, and hardware
manufacturers to use and improve the ecosystem.

**Key Results**
* Kernel developer community becomes dependent on good automation and CI
* Hardware manufacturers depend on KernelCI for production kernel quality
* Downstream kernels depend on upstream testing by KernelCI

### Objective: Community collaboration
Join forces with existing testing projects and work towards a shared set of
tooling and infrastructure.

**Key Results**
* Consolidated email reports going to kernel community: “one report to rule them
all”
* Maintain a shared reporting and visualization service (kernelci.org) for
upstream kernel testing
* Maintain a shared set of code and tools available for use by derivative
projects

### Objective: Membership growth
In order to achieve the mission and objectives, funding is needed. Funding comes
primarily from project membership dues through the Linux Foundation.

**Key Results**
* Highlight member technologies
* New members: 1-2 per year
* Available funding for on-going project management, software development,
infrastructure, support and community engagement initiatives
