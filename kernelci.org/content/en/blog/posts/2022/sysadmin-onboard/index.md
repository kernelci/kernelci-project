  The KernelCI.org project welcomes Vince Hillier as SysAdmin
---

Recently, we posted about the [Request For
Proposals](/blog/posts/2022/rfp-sysadmin/) to undertake SysAdmin tasks for
KernelCI.org. That process is now complete, and we are delighted to announce
that the KernelCI advisory board hired Vince Hillier from Revenni Inc to
conduct the work.

Vince will work together with the Technical Steering Committee
([TSC](/org/tsc/)) to maintain and improve the current project
infrastructure. As KernelCI.org scales with more kernels being built and more
tests being run, we definitely need help to keep our systems stable and up to
date.

The KernelCI project relies on a number of web services which need constant
maintenance. These include databases, automation tools and web dashboards for
several [instances](/instances/). Some are hosted on dedicated virtual
machines (VMs), others in the cloud.
